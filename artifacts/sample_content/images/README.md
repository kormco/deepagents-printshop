## Cover Image

**cover-image.jpg**
- Description: Dramatic upward shot of modern glass skyscrapers converging toward a blue sky with white clouds. The buildings have copper/bronze framing and reflect the sky, creating a sense of technological ambition and corporate innovation.
- Placement: Full-page magazine cover. The converging lines draw the eye upward, leaving space at top or bottom for the magazine title and issue details.
- Style: Should bleed to edges for maximum impact.

## Article Images

**image3.png**
- Description: A robotic hand and human hand meeting in a fist bump, symbolizing human-AI collaboration. The robot hand is highly detailed chrome/metal with blue LED accents. The human hand has a small orange sun/starburst tattoo on the wrist. Background features circular tech patterns.
- Placement: Hero image for the Cover Story ("The Year of the Agent") - place full-width after the section heading. This perfectly captures the theme of humans and AI working together.
- Caption suggestion: "The partnership between human creativity and artificial intelligence defines 2026."

**image4.jpg**
- Description: Serene ocean wave curling in misty, atmospheric conditions with a soft orange sun glowing through the haze. Calming blue-gray tones with subtle warmth from the sun's reflection on the water.
- Placement: Use in the Conclusion section ("What's Next: The Road to 2027") - works as a metaphor for waves of change and new horizons. Place as a full-width image to create a contemplative pause before final thoughts.
- Caption suggestion: "A new wave of autonomous AI approaches the horizon."

**image5.png**
- Description: Abstract geometric architecture - a building made of interlocking cubic modules stacked in an irregular but balanced pattern. Gray concrete tones against a dramatic cloudy sky. Evokes modular systems and building blocks.
- Placement: Feature image for the LangGraph & Multi-Agent Systems article. The modular building blocks visually represent how multi-agent architectures are constructed. Place wrapped right, about 40% width, near the discussion of agent orchestration.
- Caption suggestion: "Multi-agent systems: modular by design, powerful in combination."

**image6.jpg**
- Description: Modern open-plan tech office in a converted industrial space - exposed brick walls, timber beam ceiling with industrial ductwork, large windows with natural light. Rows of workstations with ergonomic chairs. A few people working at computers in the background.
- Placement: Use in the Editor's Letter (introduction) or the Industry section about MCP Protocol. Grounds the abstract AI concepts in real-world workspace context. Place wrapped left, 40% width.
- Caption suggestion: "Where the future of AI is being built, one line of code at a time."

**image7.png**
- Description: Vaporwave/synthwave style illustration of a classical Greek or Roman bust rendered in vivid neon colors - cyan, magenta, orange, and pink gradients against a black background. Features "korm.co" branding in the corner. Artistic blend of classical and futuristic aesthetics.
- Placement: Could work as a stylistic element in the Claude Code article (classical wisdom meets modern AI) or as a decorative back-cover element. If used inline, wrap left at 30% width. The bold colors make it a strong visual accent.
- Caption suggestion: "Ancient wisdom, artificial intelligence: the synthesis continues."

## Placement Guidance for LaTeX Generator

When placing images, follow these principles:

1. **Hero images** (full-width): Use at section openings for visual impact. Place after the section heading, spanning the full text width.

2. **Wrapped images** (text flows around): Good for secondary illustrations. Alternate sides (left/right) throughout the document for visual rhythm. Typical width: 40% of text width.

3. **Inline figures** (centered, text breaks): Use for important diagrams or charts that need reader's full attention. Include clear captions.

4. **Spacing**: Ensure adequate whitespace around images. Don't crowd text against images.

5. **Captions**: Every image should have a descriptive caption unless it's purely decorative (like the cover).
