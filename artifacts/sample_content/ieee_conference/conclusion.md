# Conclusion

We presented PrintShop, a multi-agent pipeline for automated professional document generation that transforms markdown manuscripts into publication-ready PDFs. The pipeline's three quality-gated stages — content editing, LaTeX generation, and visual quality assurance — are orchestrated by a LangGraph state graph with conditional edges that enable iterative refinement within each stage.

Evaluation on a benchmark of 120 documents across five content types demonstrates that PrintShop achieves 94.7% first-pass formatting accuracy and a 99.2% compilation success rate, reducing human revision cycles by 68% compared to template-based approaches. Ablation experiments confirm that the visual QA feedback loop is the single most impactful component, contributing a 7.4 percentage point accuracy improvement by detecting and correcting formatting defects that are invisible at the source level.

The system has several limitations. LLM inference costs are non-trivial: processing a single document through the full pipeline requires approximately 15 API calls on average, with cost scaling linearly with document length and iteration count. End-to-end latency of 4.3 minutes per document, while substantially faster than manual formatting, may be too slow for interactive use cases. Additionally, the visual QA stage's effectiveness is bounded by the vision-language model's ability to identify subtle typographic defects; issues such as incorrect hyphenation or minor kerning errors are not reliably detected.

Future work will explore three directions. First, integrating real-time user feedback to enable interactive document editing within the pipeline. Second, expanding the content type library to cover additional formats such as posters, slide decks, and regulatory filings. Third, investigating cost-reduction strategies such as caching intermediate results, using smaller models for routine corrections, and parallelizing independent pipeline stages.
