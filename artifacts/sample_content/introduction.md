## Welcome to Deep Agents

Dear Reader,

If 2025 was the year AI learned to act, 2026 is the year it learned to collaborate.

When we conceived of *Deep Agents* magazine, we wanted to create more than just another tech publication. We wanted to document a fundamental shift in how humans and machines work together. What started as a collection of disconnected language models has evolved into something far more profound: autonomous systems that can reason, plan, execute, and learn from their mistakes.

The numbers tell a compelling story. Gartner reports a staggering **1,445% surge** in multi-agent system inquiries from Q1 2024 to Q2 2025. The market, valued at $7.8 billion today, is projected to exceed **$52 billion by 2030**. But statistics alone don't capture the transformation happening in development teams, research labs, and enterprises worldwide.

In this inaugural issue, we explore the emergence of "deep agents"---AI systems that don't just respond to prompts but autonomously navigate complex, multi-step workflows. From Anthropic's Claude Code, which now writes 90% of its own codebase, to LangChain's production-ready frameworks powering applications at Uber and JP Morgan, we're witnessing the birth of a new paradigm.

We'll take you inside the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the standard that unified an industry, and examine how multi-agent architectures are reshaping what's possible. Along the way, we'll confront the hard questions: How do we maintain oversight of systems that can operate for hours without human intervention? What happens when agents start communicating with other agents?

This is uncharted territory. Welcome to the deep end.

**Dr. Sarah Chen**
*Editor-in-Chief, Deep Agents*
