# Introduction to AI Research

Artificial intelligence has grown rapidly in the past decade. This report looks at the current state of **machine learning** and **deep learning**. We focus on how these tools are used in natural language processing.

## Background

AI research began in the 1950s. Recent gains in computing power and data have driven major progress. *Deep neural networks* now match human performance on tasks like image recognition, speech synthesis, and language translation. These advances have opened new doors for both research and industry.

## Research Objectives

The primary goals of this research are:

- To analyze current trends in AI model design
- To compare performance metrics across different domains
- To identify future research directions and key challenges

This study builds on prior work in the field. It also introduces new methods for model training and evaluation.
